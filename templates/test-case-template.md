## üéØ Test Objective

* Simulate <short summary of technique/action> using **Atomic Red Team** in a controlled lab.
* Confirm detection logic in [`detection-rule.kql`](./detection-rule.kql) triggers as expected in Microsoft Sentinel.

---

## üìù Test Steps

1. **Lab Prep**

   * [ ] Confirm lab VM(s) and Microsoft Sentinel workspace are online.
   * [ ] (Optional) Take snapshot/backup of VMs before testing.

2. **Run Atomic Red Team Test**

   * [ ] Identify relevant ART test:
     `<Atomic Test ID/Name ‚Äì e.g., T1595.001 ‚Äì Nmap Network Scanning>`
   * [ ] Execute ART test on target VM:

     ```
     Invoke-AtomicTest <TechniqueID> -TestNumbers <TestNumber> -GetPrereqs -ShowDetails
     Invoke-AtomicTest <TechniqueID> -TestNumbers <TestNumber> -Confirm
     ```

     *(Replace with the exact ART command you use)*
   * [ ] Record execution date/time.

3. **Detection Validation**

   * [ ] In Microsoft Sentinel, open Logs and run the [`detection-rule.kql`](./detection-rule.kql) query.
   * [ ] Confirm alert/flag for the ART activity.
   * [ ] If needed, tune detection logic and retest.

4. **Documentation**

   * [ ] Screenshot ART test execution and Sentinel alerts.
   * [ ] Export relevant logs (if needed).
   * [ ] Note issues, false positives, or recommendations.
